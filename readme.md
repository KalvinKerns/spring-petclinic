# Spring Pet Clinic for the <a href="https://ibm-wsc.github.io/cloud-native-linuxone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloud Native DevOps powered by Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Z and LinuxONE Workshop</a>

This repo contains a container-ready implementation of the iconic Spring PetClinic application along with `kustomize` files for deploying this application in different OpenShift environments (dev and staging). This code is useful with the OpenShift Source-to-Image (s2i) image build technology and OpenShift Pipelines, OpenShift's cloud native CI/CD package based on Tekton.
